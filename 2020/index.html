					<h2>We are Conflict by Design</h2>

					<p class="desc">Launched in 2012, the conference is a collaborative effort between student groups at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, Harvard Business School, and Harvard College - and the only cross-school event of its kind. The event brings together creative thinkers, design luminaries, experts from a variety of backgrounds, professors, and students to engage in and reinterpret the design process as it relates to the way we run businesses, communities, governments, and systems.
					
					</br>
					</br> Now more than ever we see existing conflicts further divide and incite us, and new conflicts arise and confound us. We will explore how design has provoked and reconciled different themes of conflict, and shaped how we interpret conflict in living, conflict in human connection, and conflict in inclusion. Our speakers come from across the world and hail from diverse organizations and backgrounds – ranging from politics and social justice to art, artificial intelligence, and product design; they lead teams at Google, MIT, Microsoft AI, Co-Star, Wayfair, Space10, frog, Are.na, AI Portrait,...and more! Come hear how they have used design to incite and grapple with the conflicts of our time.</p>

His Youtube videos and online content aims to normalize Muslim lifestyle by sharing the day-to-day experiences of an average Muslim-American and discussing issues within and against the Muslim community.
